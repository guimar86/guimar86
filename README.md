# 👋 Hey, I'm Renato

🧠 I break stuff so you don't have to. Then I architect backend systems in C# and .NET Core to *fix* the stuff (usually the stuff I broke).

## 🧰 What I Actually Do

- Build APIs that don’t scream in production  
- Speak fluent SOLID, DDD, and other three-letter acronyms  
- Talk to the cloud (currently Azure) and hope it listens

## 📫 Contact Me

- Email: `guillenmartins@gmail.com`  
- Available for remote work, mentorship, or existential debates about Clean Architecture™

## 🧘‍♂️ Fun Fact

When I'm not wrestling with code, I'm probably:
- Losing at basketball 🏀  
- Winning at video games 🎮 (or at least pretending to)
